# Regression Project

## Key Concepts Learned:
- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**  
  Understanding the balance between underfitting and overfitting in models.

- **Polynomial Regression**  
  Exploring regression models with polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.

- **Regularization**  
  Techniques to prevent overfitting by adding penalties to the model.

- **L1 and L2 Loss**  
  Learning the differences and applications of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques.
